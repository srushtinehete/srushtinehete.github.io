                <p>Discovery Green proposes to bring an urban agriculture-focused education to different ages and income
                    levels. The goal is to create a mixed-income community to foster innovation and inclusion.
                    Consequently, the architecture frames the urban iconography of the site to embody the industrial
                    history, while the expansive public park serves as the spine of the neighborhood.</p>

                <p><strong>Discovery Green is the 78th neighbourhood of Chicago.</strong> Its excellent location creates
                    an interesting edge fabric. The south branch of the Chicago River runs on the west edge, Ping Tom
                    Park is to the south, high-income residential community separated by the high-traffic Clark Street
                    to the east and the raised Roosevelt Road to the north.</p>

                <p><strong>The biggest challenge to the site over the years has been connectivity</strong>To enhance
                    accessibility by all forms of transport, a new Red Line station has been proposed towards the south
                    end. Wells-Wentworth Street has been extended to provide a north-south connection for vehicular
                    traffic. 15th Street has been extended transversely to connect to Wells-Wentworth. A water taxi stop
                    has also been added along the north edge of the site to the existing water taxi route that runs from
                    Ping-Tom Park to Michigan Avenue. The site has also been raised along the north edge to ensure a
                    smooth connection from Roosevelt Road. Bike lanes and pedestrian paths criss-cross all across the 62
                    acres.</p>

                <p><strong>Discovery Green aims to create an inclusive community based on education for all.</strong>The
                    user traffic to the entire neighbourhood would consist of neighbours, students, residents and
                    office-goers. University students from across Chicago and Illinois coming into the Innovation
                    Center, high-schoolers would participate in the innovation centre while going to school. The
                    vocational school will provide trade-specific education to students of all ages and incomes.
                    Co-working spaces provide traffic to the south part of the site next to the new Red Line Station.
                    Different types of residential typologies- from affordable housing to market-rate apartments and
                    townhouses- ensure a mixed-income community. The central green belt, it’s subsequent ‘fingers’ and
                    the developed riverfront will bring in neighbours from Dearborn Park, Chinatown, Bridgeport, Pilsen
                    and the Loop.</p>

                <p><strong>The site has been laid out to exhibit the city’s historic iconography.</strong>The Sears
                    Tower, Charles Bridge and the Union Power Station are some of the older icons that can be seen from
                    various points on the site. Clark Street has been opened up to pedestrian traffic by adding pavement
                    and introducing retail facing the road. The green belt facilitates a smooth transition from the
                    neighbouring parks.</p>

                <p>By taking these various design decisions, it will create a more inclusive neighbourhood that
                    fosters the growth of the city by giving impetus to education for all. Leading towards
                    it. Urban agricultural innovation and education. History of Chicago as an industrial city- bringing
                    new technology by tying old + new. Respect for history, embody history, prominent sight lines.</p>
